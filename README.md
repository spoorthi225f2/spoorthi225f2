## 🔭 Currently  
- Developing full-stack web applications using **Spring Boot**, deployed on **Apache Tomcat**.  
- Working on a detailed project proposal for Google Summer of Code 2025: *“CARE IM Bot Integration”* — building a generic IM-wrapper and WhatsApp bot for hospital-patient interactions.  
- Preparing for AI-focused interviews: studying key topics, solving problems, building projects.  
- Deepening theoretical CS understanding: covering topics like CFGs, PDAs, Turing Machines, Undecidability (of UNIT IV & V, JNTU R22).  
- Learning scripting with Tcl: control flow, loops, widgets, namespaces, regex, event handling.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning  
- Advanced microservices with Spring and container orchestration.  
- Natural Language Processing and bot frameworks (WhatsApp integration, IM wrappers).  
- Refining my algorithm & data structure skills (DSA) for interview readiness.  
- Improving understanding of formal languages & automata theory.

## 🧰 My Tech Stack  
| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Java, Spring Boot, Tomcat, REST APIs |
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS, JavaScript |
| Scripting / Automation | Tcl (Tk) |
| Theoretical CS | Context-Free Grammars, Pushdown Automata, Turing Machines, Undecidability |
| Tools & Workflow | Git, GitHub, Docker (for offline CPU-only processing), VS Code / IntelliJ |

## 📂 Featured Projects  
Here are a few of my highlighted repositories:  
- **Baby-Bloom** – A Java-based full-stack web application.

## 🎯 My Goals  
- Contribute to meaningful open source, particularly in healthcare-tech and AI-bots.  
- Get selected for Google Summer of Code 2025 and deliver a high-impact project.  
- Land a role or internship in AI or backend development where I can apply both theory and practice.  
- Keep sharpening both my practical coding skills and theoretical CS foundations.
